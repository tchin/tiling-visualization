Given a list of ideals (from Macaulay2 output), visualize the edges in each component. Binomial terms will be drawn in red, while monomial terms will be drawn in blue.

Instructions to use:
1. Generate (radicals of) the primary decomposition of the ideal in Macaulay2
2. Output the radical to a file using "[filename]" << toString [list of radicals] << close
3. In the command line, type python visualize.py <m> <n> <path/to/file>, where m and n are the dimensions of the graph (the parameters you used in Macaulay2)

A window will pop up showing a visualization of the edges contained in each ideal from the input file.
